#### Introduction 

A fingertip pulse oximeter is a fairly complicated piece of equipment which is usually simple to use. Follow these steps to easily operate a fingertip pulse oximeter.

1. Turn it on.
2. Clip it on.
3. Let it measure.
4. Read the device.

#### Turn it On
Press the __ON__ button. The device should start up immediately.
* If the device does not start up, check the batteries!

#### Clip it On
Clip the device on to any finger.
* Avoid using thumbs; the readings from thumbs are less reliable.

#### Wait 
Set your hand down and relax as you wait for measurements.
* Give it 5 to 10 seconds to get a reading.
* Moving excessively will affect the reading, so try to relax.

#### Read
Read the displayed results.
* Your blood oxygen saturation level, often marked SpO2, should be between 94% to 99% for healthy people.
* Normal heart rates range from 60 to 100 beats per minute. This is usually marked PR for pulse rate or BPM for beats per minute.
