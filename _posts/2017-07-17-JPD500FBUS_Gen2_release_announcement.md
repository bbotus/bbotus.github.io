Biobotus announces the release of a second generation version of the popular Jumper Bluetooth Pulse Oximeter (JPD-500FBUS).  Wireless, lightweight, and easy-to-use, the fingertip pulse oximeter quickly and accurately measures saturated blood oxygen levels, pulse rate, and perfusion index.  Using bluetooth capabilities, the pulse oximeter can utilize a free mobile app (available on iOS or Android) to track your data.  Based off of the reliable original design, the 2nd generation JPD-500FBUS has been further developed to be more lightweight and sportier.  Biobotus continues to value its partnership with Jumper to bring users accessible and affordable home healthcare products.
